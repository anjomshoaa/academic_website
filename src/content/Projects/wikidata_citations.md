Wikidata is a rapidly growing user-edited open knowledge graph that provides easy access to structured data. Since Wikidata allows contradictory information, references are crucial for supporting statements and tracking the source of information. Consequently, investigating the use, types, and scientific value of references within Wikidata is essential. In this paper, we will first conduct a heuristic evaluation of Wikidata references using a sampling method. Subsequently, we will focus on a specific category of references, Digital Object Identifiers
(DOIs), known for citing scientific publications. Our sampled Wikidata statements analysis indicates widespread adoption of the DOI system within Wikidata. To assess the quality of scholarly resources referenced in Wikidata, we used percentile metrics derived from the OpenAlex platform. Additionally, h-index indicators from OpenAlex were employed to evaluate the credibility of these sources and determine whether the Wikidata citations originated from reputable sources or publishers. Our findings show that papers in the social and physical sciences tend to perform better in Wikidata compared to OpenAlex. Moreover, while top-tier journals dominate citations in OpenAlex—particularly in the health and life sciences— Wikidata shows a higher citation rate for mid-tier and emerging journals. This indicates a broader representation of scholarly contributions within Wikidata.
