I'm a senior researcher at the Institute for Data, Process, and Knowledge Management at the Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU Vienna). I also serves as Director at Research Studio Austria for both the Data Science Studio in Vienna and the SDIS Studio in Lower Austria. I'm a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow and an Erwin Schrödinger Fellow, with a distinguished background as a researcher and project lead at various institutions, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Complexity Science Hub Vienna, the National University of Ireland, Lero (Science Foundation Ireland), SBA Research Austria, and the Vienna University of Technology.
I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Vienna University of Technology in 2009. I holds dual Master’s degrees in Software Engineering & Internet Computing (2005) and Information Management (2007), both from the Vienna University of Technology, and a Bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of Kerman.
