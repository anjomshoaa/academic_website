While AI-driven automation for VF is advancing rapidly, current VF systems lack integrated, dynamic mechanisms for regulatory compliance, posing operational and legal challenges. This project will address these gaps with a specific focus on integrating lightweight AI models with decentralized compliance mechanisms, considering both sustainability and societal impact.Figure 1.2.1 illustrates our framework in unified architecture supporting real-time, privacy-aware, and legally aligned decision-making.

This PhD project proposes the development of a regulation-compliant, privacy-preserving, and decentralized AI framework designed to support autonomous decision-making in smart agriculture specifically targeting vertical farming (VF) and aquaponics systems. Despite increasing digitization in controlled-environment agriculture, current solutions often lack scalable mechanisms to ensure continuous legal compliance across diverse jurisdictions and evolving regulations, particularly concerning data protection, food safety, and environmental sustainability.

To address these gaps, the project integrates federated learning (FL), Edge AI, and regulatory knowledge modeling into a unified, modular architecture. By embedding machine-readable compliance logic into AI workflows, the proposed system enables real-time, locally informed, yet globally aligned decision-making—without compromising privacy or sovereignty. The research will leverage active testbeds at RSA FG SDIS’s AgrarSense and Eden platforms, combining sensor fusion, environmental control systems, and historical datasets to validate methods in real-world agricultural conditions.

Key research outcomes include scalable FL algorithms customized for heterogeneous edge environments, methods for integrating regulatory ontologies into model optimization, and mechanisms for continuous system adaptation to legal updates. The proposed solution aligns with Austria’s national AI and sustainability goals, supports compliance with EU frameworks like GAIA-X and the European Green Deal, and contributes to trustworthy, autonomous, and legally grounded agri-tech innovation.
